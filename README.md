# Best-Artwork-of-All-Times
## Multiclass classification using ResNet18 and DCGAN models.
The aim of the project was to classify each painting in the correct author.

In order to do so we implemented several Recurrent Neural Networks, among wich the ResNet18 was the one with the best performance regarding test accuracy. We also decided to try facing the problem from a completely different pint of view, implementing a DCGAN model from which we extrapolated the Discriminator alogithm and adapted it to our specific classification task.
